Location intelligence changes the dynamic of the fight against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Maps and geographic information systems (GIS) provide valuable insights to manage the crisis, maintain continuity of operations, and increase resilience for long-term recovery. The following are three main areas where GIS can play a significant role in combating the pandemic

1. Manage the crisis: Maps provide a common frame of reference and integrate all types of relevant data. Maps can aid better visualization, understanding, and response planning for decision makers in a rapidly changing environment.
2. Maintain continuity of operations: Location intelligence provides real-time insights about the impact the pandemic is having on the workforce, businesses, and facilities. Location intelligence helps decision makers estimate the resources required to keep organizations moving forward.
3. Increase overall resilience: Organizations need a system in place for understanding and responding to crises of all types and sizes. GIS provides the tools needed to integrate data, activities, and missions that support collaborative action, leaving organizations better prepared for response.

Below are the product components recommended to get started for mapping and analyzing COVID-19 data.

1. ArcGIS Enterprise : ArcGIS Enterprise is the foundational software system for GIS, powering mapping and visualization, analytics, and data management. It is the backbone for running the Esri suite of applications and your own custom applications. ArcGIS Enterprise is tightly integrated with ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Pro for mapping and authoring, and seamlessly connects with ArcGIS Online to share content between systems.
2. ArcGIS Pro: It is a powerful Desktop GIS application for authoring, editing, and geoprocessing that allows you to create beautiful maps, edit and manage spatial data, and perform the full spectrum of analyses needed to turn your raw data into valuable information.
3. Insights for ArcGIS: ArcGIS Insights is analysis software that fuses location analytics with open data science and business intelligence workflows. It allows you to explore data and perform advanced analytics such as spatial, statistical, predictive, and link analysis within an intuitive experience.

**ArcGIS Enterprise on Microsoft Azure**

One of the three methods can be used to deploy ArcGIS Enterprise on Azure

1. [Esri Images in Azure Marketplace.](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/cloud/azure/esri-images-on-azure-marketplace.htm)
2. [ArcGIS Azure ARM Template](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-azure-templates)
3. [CloudBuilder – A custom UI to deploy ArcGIS in Azure](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/cloud/azure/what-is-arcgis-server-cloud-builder-for-microsoft-azure.htm)

After deploying ArcGIS Enterprise on an Azure VM, ArcGIS Desktop and Insights for ArcGIS can be installed on the same machine. This will enable consuming data provided by other partners from the postgres database and consuming it as map services through the ArcGIS Rest API.
