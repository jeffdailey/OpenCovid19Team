**Coronavirus Response Solution**

[Coronavirus Response](https://solutions.arcgis.com/local-government/help/coronavirus-response/) is a collection of maps and apps that helps public health and other emergency response agencies understand the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) and share authoritative information about the pandemic with their communities. With these maps and apps, you can monitor cases, track the status of public gathering places, inventory facilities where people can get testing and treatment, monitor the status of meal programs, and make this information available to citizens. This helps you keep people informed and guide public health actions in your community.

You can use the Coronavirus Response solution to:

- Monitor coronavirus cases—Coronavirus Response lets you track, report, and monitor coronavirus cases in your community. The solution includes a survey app that public health staff can use to tabulate coronavirus cases. It also includes dashboards that gives incident commanders, government leaders, and the public an overview of confirmed cases and their impact to the community. By giving you an easy way to collect and report on this data, these apps help you reduce reliance on national-level data, mitigate the spread of misinformation, and make informed decisions to safeguard public health.
- Track the impact on public gathering places—As the threat of the coronavirus has spread, many schools, government buildings, hospitals, and other common places have closed or altered their hours. With Coronavirus Response, public health staff and other stakeholders can manage information about the status of these public gathering places. This lets you keep track of which public places are closed and when they plan to reopen.
- Inventory testing sites—Testing is critical to reducing the spread and severity of infections. Coronavirus Response includes an app that lets public health staff add local testing sites to your inventory and plot their information on a map. With this information, you can help people locate available coronavirus testing sites, so they can get testing and treatment promptly when necessary.
- Monitor meal programs—Many school districts and communities are offering free or reduced-price meals to alleviate the hardships caused by closures to schools and businesses. Coronavirus Response includes apps that help staff maintain an inventory of meal pickup locations, tabulate the number of meals served at each site, and monitor KPIs through a high-level dashboard. With this level of visibility into meal sites, officials can more effectively monitor and manage their meal programs.
- Share authoritative information with the public—Coronavirus Response includes public-facing apps that share data collected by public health staff and other stakeholders. These apps help citizens quickly find information about how the pandemic impacts them. For example, citizens can see case statistics, look up available testing sites, find treatment facilities like hospitals and clinics, locate the meal programs that serve them, and identify which schools and government buildings are closed. By sharing this authoritative information with citizens, you can improve communication and increase public awareness.

**Coronavirus Business Continuity solution**

[The Coronavirus Business Continuity](https://solutions.arcgis.com/shared/help/coronavirus-business-continuity/) solution is designed to help you better understand how COVID-19 is impacting your facilities and workforce capacity. The solution lets you monitor facilities to better understand which locations are open, impacted, or closed. It also lets you monitor the work status of employees, so you know who is working and where they are working. Optionally, the solution supports health status checks and lets employees self-report critical information. You can communicate this facility and workforce information to internal and external stakeholders, helping everyone make decisions from the same authoritative data. You can use the solution to:

- Understand impacts to facilities. The solution makes it easy for facility managers to report on the status of stores, offices, and other facilities, especially as this status changes over time. This allows you to stay up to date on closures and other business impacts.
- Understand impacts to employees. The solution gives you tools to gather information about the status of your employees, including whether they are working from their designated office space, temporarily working from home, or working in another location. This makes it easier to understand where your employees are working and how facility closures and state restrictions are impacting your workforce.
- Understand health (COVID-19) status. Depending on your organization&#39;s policies, you can configure the solution to gather information about employee health impacts. Employees can self-report information that helps you understand who is healthy and who might require assistance.You can direct at-risk employees to the appropriate health resources. You can also use health status information to make workforce planning decisions that minimize exposure to other employees.
- Make better decisions. When you understand how the coronavirus is impacting your facilities and employees, you can make decisions that account for those impacts. For example, if some of your facilities have closed, you might reallocate staff to support increased demand for services at nearby facilities that remain open. Similarly, if some of your staff are working from home as a result of local restrictions, you might reassign field work to employees that are able to service customers in a specific area. The Coronavirus Business Continuity solution delivers its value from three core capabilities:1. The ability to monitor facility status2. The ability to monitor workforce capacity (employee status) 3. Optionally, the ability to monitor employee health status. Many organizations are looking for exactly these capabilities
- Communicate more effectively. The solution helps you reduce confusion and misinformation through more effective communication. The solution includes tools for sharing authoritative information with internal stakeholders, so they can use current information for better decision-making. The solution also lets you share information with external stakeholders like customers or the public, so they know which stores, offices, and facilities have been impacted. This makes it easier for people to understand which locations are closed, which are operating under reduced hours, and which are operating normally.

**Coronavirus Testing Sites**

[Coronavirus Testing Sites](https://solutions.arcgis.com/shared/help/coronavirus-testing-sites/) is a collection of maps and apps that can be used by Public Health and other emergency response agencies to identify at-risk populations and develop coronavirus (COVID-19) testing site plans.
